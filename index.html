                Anioma people are an Igbo speaking subgroup in Delta State, Nigeria. A genetically distinct and heterogeneous group, the ethnicity is popularly referred to as “Delta Igbo”. They encompass the communities which span across the 9 northeastern Local Government Areas of Delta State and speak Igbo derived dialects of varying varieties including the Enuani languages and Ukwuani language. Igbo itself is a member of the Igboid languages of the Niger-Congo linguistic family. The similarity of the dialects is gradated and generally decreases in linguistic proximity to Igbo the further away from the Niger. They occupy Delta North Senatorial District, which consists of the Enuani (Oshimili/Aniocha), and Ukwuani/Ndokwa geographical and linguistic zones of Delta State. Anioma is translated literally into “Good Land” in Igbo but is originally an acronym to refer to the region’s peoples. An ancient and industrious nation, the ethnic group is estimated to have a total population of approximately 1.8 million people. The largest Anioma settlement and urban area is the Delta State Capital Territory which incorporates the city of Asaba along the Niger with Okpanam and Igbuzor and their respective neighborhoods.
