                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Anioma people are an Igbo speaking subgroup in Delta State, Nigeria. A genetically distinct and heterogeneous group, the ethnicity is popularly referred to as “Delta Igbo”. They encompass the communities which span across the 9 northeastern Local Government Areas of Delta State and speak Igbo derived dialects of varying varieties including the Enuani languages and Ukwuani language. Igbo itself is a member of the Igboid languages of the Niger-Congo linguistic family. <br> <br> <br> 


                    The similarity of the dialects is gradated and generally decreases in                   linguistic proximity to Igbo the further away from the Niger. They occupy                   Delta North Senatorial District, which consists of the Enuani (Oshimili/                Aniocha), and Ukwuani/Ndokwa geographical and linguistic zones of Delta                 State. Anioma is translated literally into “Good Land” in Igbo but is           originally an acronym to refer to the region’s peoples. An ancient and                    industrious nation, the ethnic group is estimated to have a total               population of approximately 1.8 million people. The largest Anioma                  settlement and urban area is the Delta State Capital Territory which            incorporates the city of Asaba along the Niger with Okpanam and Igbuzor         and their respective neighborhoods.

            <h2>Face Of <span>Anioma</span> Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Face of Anioma is a Non Governmental Organisation, saddled with the vision and responsibility of seeking for Anioma Cultural Renaissance through the promotion of the cultural identities and values of Anioma communities. It is a forum that focuses attention on the needs and challenges of the young generations of Anioma people, through a concentrated effort towards their value reorientation, skills acquisition and empowerment, amongst others. 

                In achieving these, there is a conscious effort on the part of the forum                to engage youths in attitudinal change with regards to Anioma local             languages, for the benefit of our children at home and in the Diaspora. 

                This project is anchored on technology driven knowledge, value, dignity of              our cherished cultural heritage, gender inclusivity and development. 

                In a nutshell, it is envisioned to develop a symbiotic connection between               the people at home and abroad, to showcase our rich culture and achieve             cultural relevance on the international space.
